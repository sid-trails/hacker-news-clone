# hacker-news-clone
Test Application for pulling Hacker News, **Ephasises On Design and Responsive nature**

# Architectural Decision Records

## Record #1

### Style Decisions

Using React-Bootstrap for styling as it is a basic and has all the semantic styles that are required and also provides component level imports which makes our package size also minimal.

### Component Design

Planing to have 3  High level Components

- Navbar
- NavLinks that will change the content
- Content Lists
  - Content Element
  - Hide Element
  - Paginate Elements

### Storage
  Thought process is to use local storage. in a custom hook so it can be easily replaceable.

### Charts
Initial Plan is to use Chart Js.

### Hosting
Will Deploy on to Azure web app. Not thinking of a docker yet as its a simple server less architecture that can host node applications directly with vertical scalling :)

# Notes From CRA

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
